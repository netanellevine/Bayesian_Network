# Bayesian Network

## Summery:  
In this project I implemented a Bayesian Network in Java programming language, and answering questions about this network such as:  
 **_For example A, B, C, are variables in the network representing an event._**   
* "Are A and B Conditionally independent given an evidence C". 
* "What is the probability that an event A will happen given that an 
event B didn't happen".    
  
This type of questions are being answered by using two familiar Algorithms:
* Bayes Ball Algorithm (also known as D-Separation). 
* Variable Elimination Algorithm.
