# Bayesian Network
___
##Summery:
This project is implementing Bayesian Network and answering questions such as:
* "Are A and B Conditionally independent given an evidence C". [^1] 
* "What is the probability that an event A will happen given that an 
event B didn't happen".[^2]

This type of questions are being answered by using two familiar Algorithms:
* [^1]:Bayes Ball Algorithm (also known an D-Separation). 
* [^2]:Variable Elimination Algorithm.
